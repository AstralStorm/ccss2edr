# ccss2edr

This tool converts Argyll .ccss (Colorimeter Calibration Spectral Set) files to the X-Rite
.edr format. The motivation is to possibly get more accurate color calibration with the Dell
UltraSharp Color Calibration Solution by feeding it a more accurate backlight spectrum profile
instead of a generic W-LED or RG-LED profile.
